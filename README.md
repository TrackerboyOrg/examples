### Guidelines

In general, module submissions will be accepted as long as there is reasonable
effort put into them. But here are a couple guidelines to follow:

 * Provide descriptive names for all of your songs, instruments and waveforms.
 * Provide artist information for the module (in TrackerBoy you can edit this
   via Module > Module Properties `Ctrl+P`)
 * Add some comments to the module if you wanna explain your process, or any
   extra details (in TrackerBoy: Module > Comments...).
 * Regarding comments and names: Keep it PG, avoid offensive language.
 * Song covers/rips should mention the original composer, as well as copyright
   information.
 * The submitted filename must have a tbm extension (*.tbm).

### Filename format

Modules in this repository should follow this format for organization purposes:

```
[author]-[title].tbm
```

Where `author` is the name of the submitter, typically an online handle, and
must only contain characters `a..z`, `A..Z`, `0..9` and `_`. This name must be
unique in the repository. It is best to use something that people can search
for, so they can find your other works if available.

The `title` is the title of the module, can be anything as long as it describes
the module succintly. This title must not contain any non-printable characters,
as well as characters forbidden on Windows, `\/:*?"<>|`.

be available for download publically at this repository. The modules may also
be made available for download at [trackerboy.org](https://www.trackerboy.org)
and other websites managed by the TrackerBoy Team.

The TrackerBoy Team may also use these modules for testing purposes. 

You may request your module to be removed from this repository at any point in
time, however, it will still be accessible in this repository's git history.
Deleted modules will no longer appear in releases of TrackerBoy after the date
of the delete request.

You may also request your module to be updated with a newer version at any point
in time. Same with deletions, updated modules will appear in releases of
TrackerBoy after the date in which the modification request was approved.

By submitting a module, you agree to these terms.
